# OTN Workshop targets

This branch is an exercise in converting the workflows outlined in the living [OTN workshop materials](https://ocean-tracking-network.github.io/otn-workshop-base/) to [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/).

**ANY PULL REQUESTS FROM THIS BRANCH TO `main` WILL BE REJECTED!**
